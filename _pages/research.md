### Deep Learning of Systematic Data Assimilation Increments in the Ocean
<span style="font-size:0.85em;"> At **Princeton**, I am involved in an industry-funded multi-institutional project to reduce biases at the ocean-atmosphere interface in climate models by leveraging observations and machine learning methods. We consider data assimilation (DA) increments as proxies for errors arising from deficiencies in fast physics (along with the fast dynamics and the numerics) in an ocean general circulation model and train neural networks of different sizes, architectures, and predictors to learn systematic DA increments from local stratification, shears, and surface fluxes. We evaluate and interpret the resulting deep-learned models and investigate predictions in terms of various physical processes. The DA increments are derived from the GFDLâ€™s SPEAR-ODA system (Seamless  System for Prediction and EArth System Research-Ocean Data  Assimilation), which assimilates observed sea surface temperature and vertical profiles of temperature and salinity from the Argo dataset. These local state-dependent neural networks form the basis for data-driven model error parameterization and bias correction techniques. </span>

### Mechanisms of Arctic Freshwater Variability and its impacts
<span style="font-size:0.85em;"> At **Los Alamos National Laboratory** (LANL), I investigated atmospheric and oceanic drivers of freshening of the Arctic Ocean using a large ensemble of coupled climate model simulations and an observationally forced ocean sea ice simulation using the Community Earth System Model (CESM) framework. The Arctic Ocean has accumulated an unprecedented amount of liquid freshwater in the last two decades. We identified the primary drivers of freshening and quantified the relative contribution of different sources using the freshwater budget analysis. We also distinguished between anthropogenically caused and naturally varying freshening signals by contrasting the response in two simulations. Thinning of the Arctic sea ice is largely anthropogenically forced and primarily contributes to the freshening of the Arctic Ocean. We also found that the climate system's natural variability strongly influences gateway freshwater transports via ocean circulation changes and affects the accumulation's magnitude, timing and spatial pattern. </span>

<span style="font-size:0.85em;"> I worked on an ocean modeling study that tracks freshwater from the Beaufort Gyre in the western Arctic Ocean and quantifies its effect on the North Atlantic Ocean's salinity. We found that during 1983-1995, the freshwater released from the Beaufort Gyre crossed the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and Davis Strait before freshening up the Labrador Sea by ~0.2 psu. In collaboration with NCAR, I assessed the hindcast skill of an initialized decadal prediction large ensemble in predicting observed variations in the Arctic freshwater content. Such predictions often suffer from systematic errors called initialization-induced decadal drift. I worked on developing a new dynamical drift correction technique that removes bias and improves predictive skills over currently used methods. </span>

### Deep Learning of Subpolar North Atlantic SST
<span style="font-size:0.85em;">As a part of an internal LANL grant sponsored by the Center for Space and Earth Science, I developed a deep-learning model to forecast high-latitude climate variability on seasonal to interannual timescales. The end goal was to investigate physical processes that provide predictability on different timescales and understand the benefits of using deep learning. For this purpose, a convolutional neural network (CNN) that predicts subpolar North Atlantic Sea Surface Temperature (SST) from prior SST and upper ocean heat content fields was trained on data from a long preindustrial control simulation with the CESM. The results were compared against autoregressive and (spatially extended) linear inverse models as benchmarks. </span>

### Climate Extremes and Tropical Ocean Dynamical Response to Sulfate Aerosols  
<span style="font-size:0.85em;"> My Ph.D. research at **Texas A&M University** included i) investigating the effect of sea surface temperature and synoptic variability on climate extremes over the continental United States using the Weather Research Forecasting model and ii) investigating aerosols' impact on tropical climate using the hierarchy of CESM simulations. In the first part, I studied the remote effect of SST interannual variability on precipitation and temperature extremes over the United States. The impact of propagating synoptic disturbances on the simulated mean state was also studied by changing the western lateral boundary conditions. The second part was carried out in collaboration with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. I studied coupled ocean-atmosphere processes over the tropical Pacific and how anthropogenic sulfate aerosols affect them. The possibility of sulfate emissions from Asia as a potential source of seasonal-interannual predictability through its impact on ENSO dynamics was explored in this work. As a part of this work, I performed and analyzed a large ensemble of coupled and uncoupled climate model experiments using CESM. </span>
