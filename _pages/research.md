<span style="font-size:0.75em;"> At **Princeton**, I am involved in an industry-funded multi-institutional project to reduce biases at the ocean-atmosphere interface in climate models by leveraging observations and machine learning methods. We consider data assimilation (DA) increments as proxies for errors arising from deficiencies in fast physics (along with the fast dynamics and the numerics) in an ocean general circulation model and train neural networks of different sizes, architectures, and predictors to learn systematic DA increments from local stratification, shears, and surface fluxes. We evaluate and interpret the resulting deep-learned models and investigate predictions in terms of various physical processes. The DA increments are derived from the GFDLâ€™s SPEAR-ODA system (Seamless  System for Prediction and EArth System Research-Ocean Data  Assimilation), which assimilates observed sea surface temperature and vertical profiles of temperature and salinity from the Argo dataset. These local state-dependent neural networks form the basis for data-driven model error parameterization and bias correction techniques. </span>

<span style="font-size:0.75em;"> At **Los Alamos National Laboratory** (LANL), I studied mechanisms of the Arctic freshwater variability using a large ensemble of fully-coupled climate model simulations and an observationally forced ocean-sea ice simulation using the Community Earth System Model (CESM) framework. We distinguished between anthropogenically caused and naturally varying signals by contrasting the responses in the two simulations. We found that the thinning of the Arctic sea ice is largely anthropogenically forced and primarily contributes to the recent freshening of the Arctic Ocean. The climate system's natural variability strongly influences gateway freshwater transports via ocean circulation changes and affects the accumulation's magnitude, timing, and spatial pattern.  </span>

<span style="font-size:0.75em;"> I worked on an ocean modeling study that tracks freshwater from the Beaufort Gyre in the western Arctic Ocean and quantifies its effect on the North Atlantic Ocean's salinity. We found that during 1983-1995, the freshwater released from the Beaufort Gyre crossed the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and Davis Strait before freshening up the Labrador Sea by ~0.2 psu. In collaboration with NCAR, I assessed the hindcast skill of an initialized decadal prediction large ensemble in predicting observed variations in the Arctic freshwater content. Such predictions often suffer from systematic errors called initialization-induced decadal drift. I worked on developing a new dynamical drift correction technique that removes bias and improves predictive skills over currently used methods. </span>

</p>
<span style="font-size:0.75em;">As a part of an internal LANL grant sponsored by the Center for Space and Earth Science, I developed a deep-learning model to forecast high-latitude climate variability on seasonal to interannual timescales. The goal was to investigate physical processes providing predictability on different timescales and understand the benefits of using deep learning over traditional statistical approaches. For this purpose, convolutional neural networks predicting subpolar North Atlantic Sea Surface Temperature (SST) from prior SST and upper ocean heat content fields were trained on data from a long preindustrial control simulation with the CESM. The results were compared against autoregressive and (spatially extended) linear inverse models as benchmarks. </span>

</p>
<span style="font-size:0.75em;"> My Ph.D. research at **Texas A&M University** included i) investigating the effect of sea surface temperature and synoptic variability on climate extremes over the continental United States using the Weather Research Forecasting model and ii) investigating aerosols' impact on tropical climate using the hierarchy of CESM simulations. In the first part, I studied the remote effect of SST interannual variability on precipitation and temperature extremes over the United States. The impact of propagating synoptic disturbances on the simulated mean state was also studied by changing the western lateral boundary conditions. The second part was carried out in collaboration with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. I studied coupled ocean-atmosphere processes over the tropical Pacific and how anthropogenic sulfate aerosols affect them. The possibility of sulfate emissions from Asia as a potential source of seasonal-interannual predictability through its impact on ENSO dynamics was explored in this work. As a part of this work, I performed and analyzed a large ensemble of coupled and uncoupled climate model experiments using CESM. </span>
