<span style="font-size:0.9em;"> I am a computational climate scientist interested in studying and modeling processes across the atmosphere, ocean, and cryosphere. I study processes that span a wide range of spatial and time scales, from the tropics to the poles. My research is guided by the need to improve our predictive understanding of weather and climate systems. </span>

<span style="font-size:0.9em;"> I utilize both physics-based models and data-driven methods to address questions about climate change and variability, predictability, uncertainty, and extremes. These tools typically range from simple regression models to fully complex general circulation models. </span> 

<span style="font-size:0.9em;"> In the past, my research has involved studying polar climate, El Nino Southern Oscillation, decadal prediction systems, aerosols, clouds, sea ice, Arctic freshwater, and machine learning. You can learn more about it in publications. </span>
