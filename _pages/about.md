<span style="font-size:0.85em;"> As a computational climate scientist, I study and model processes across the atmosphere, ocean, and cryosphere that span a wide range of spatial and time scales, from the tropics to the poles. </span>

<span style="font-size:0.85em;"> I utilize idealized physics-based models, complex general circulation models, and statistical and machine-learning methods to address questions about anthropogenic climate change, climate variability, predictability, uncertainty, and extremes. My research interests are fundamentally guided by the need to improve the predictive understanding of weather and climate systems. In the past, my research has involved studying polar climate, El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), heat waves, decadal predictions, aerosols, clouds, sea ice, Arctic freshwater, and machine learning. You can find more information about it in my research and publications. </span> 

<span style="font-size:0.85em;"> My education, research expertise, and interests are diverse. I hold two master's degrees, one in physics and the other in climate science. My master's thesis in climate science from the [Indian Institute of Sciences](https://iisc.ac.in/) was on data assimilation in low-dimensional Lorenz and complex atmospheric general circulation models. My Ph.D. thesis at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/) investigated the radiative impacts of short-term sulfate aerosol forcing on ENSO variability. My postdoctoral research at [Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://www.lanl.gov/) focused on studying Arctic freshwater variability mechanisms and systematic errors that impair coupled earth system decadal prediction systems. My recent research position at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/) is part of a multi-institution collaboration called [M2LInES](https://m2lines.github.io/), which focuses on studying fundamental small-scale oceanic processes and improving their representation in coarse-resolution climate models using novel machine-learning approaches. </span>
